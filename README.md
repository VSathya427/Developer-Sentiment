# Developer Sentiments

This project explores using NoSQL querying for data analysis, demonstrating that NoSQL can do more than just data retrieval. It highlights how NoSQL can be used to structure data in a way that allows for direct visualization, such as generating graphs, without the need for additional processing in Python.

All implemented queries are documented in the accompanying report.
